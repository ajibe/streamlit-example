* **Number of turns in spiral:** Determines the number of complete rotations the spiral makes.

### Outputs

* An interactive scatter plot of the generated spiral, where:
   * Each point on the spiral is represented by a blue circle.
   * The spiral's radius increases as you move away from the center.
   * Users can adjust the spiral's parameters using the provided sliders.
