# Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Naming Conventions

1.1 Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
   - Choose names that clearly convey the purpose or content of the element.
   - Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood.

1.2 Follow consistent capitalization conventions:
   - Use camelCase for variables and function names.
   - Use PascalCase for class names.
   - Use UPPER_CASE for constants.

1.3 Prefix private methods and variables with an underscore (_).

## 2. Code Structure

2.1 Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single task.
   - Aim for functions under 20-30 lines of code.
   - If a function grows too large, consider breaking it into smaller, more manageable pieces.

2.2 Use consistent indentation (preferably 4 spaces) to improve readability.

2.3 Organize code into logical sections with clear separation between them.
   - Group related functions and classes together.
   - Use comments to denote major sections of code.

2.4 Limit line length to 80-100 characters for better readability.

2.5 Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to minimize code duplication.

## 3. Documentation

3.1 Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or algorithms.
   - Focus on why the code does something, not what it does (which should be clear from the code itself).

3.2 Use docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules.
   - Include a brief description, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised.

3.3 Keep documentation up-to-date as code changes.

3.4 Include a README file in the project root with setup instructions and basic usage examples.

## 4. Error Handling

4.1 Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
   - Catch specific exceptions rather than using bare except clauses.

4.2 Provide meaningful error messages that help in diagnosing and fixing issues.

4.3 Log errors and exceptions with appropriate detail for debugging.

4.4 Fail fast: Detect and report errors as early as possible in the execution flow.

## 5. Performance

5.1 Write efficient code, but prioritize readability and maintainability over premature optimization.

5.2 Use appropriate data structures and algorithms for the task at hand.

5.3 Minimize the use of global variables to reduce side effects and improve modularity.

5.4 Profile your code to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.

## 6. Security

6.1 Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

6.2 Use parameterized queries when working with databases to prevent SQL injection.

6.3 Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords or API keys in the source code.
   - Use environment variables or secure configuration files instead.

6.4 Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

6.5 Keep dependencies up-to-date to address known security vulnerabilities.

## 7. Version Control

7.1 Use meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made.

7.2 Make small, focused commits rather than large, sweeping changes.

7.3 Use feature branches for developing new features or major changes.

7.4 Regularly merge or rebase with the main branch to stay up-to-date.

## 8. Testing

8.1 Write unit tests for all new code and maintain existing tests.

8.2 Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical parts of the application.

8.3 Run tests before committing code and ensure all tests pass before merging.

8.4 Include both positive and negative test cases to ensure robust code.
